# Sample Markdown File

## Introduction

This is a sample Markdown file to demonstrate various common elements.

### Paragraphs

Markdown supports plain text, and it's automatically converted into paragraphs. You can write text just like you would in any editor.

To start a new paragraph, leave a blank line between lines of text.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

You can create code blocks using backticks.

### Inline Code

One cool thing about Tailwind CSS is that it makes it easy to change the CSS at each screen breakpoints using class prefixes. For example, I wanted to have a "hamburger" menu for small to medium screens, and a text menu for large screens, I can use the prefix `lg`. This indicates that on default, the style is `display:hidden`, but on large screens (1024 px) and above, it's set to `block`. It's really useful for sizing content responsively as well.

### Multiline Code Block

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```
